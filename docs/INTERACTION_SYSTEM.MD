# Interaction & Interrogation Systems
**System:** SocialLayer
**Related Files:** `InteractionRouter.ts`, `InterrogationOverlay.tsx`, `RumorRegistry.ts`

## 1. Interaction Hierarchy
When a player clicks an entity, the `InteractionRouter` processes it in this order:
1. **Crisis (Priority 1):** Intercepts if a bomb/poison scenario is active.
2. **Dialogue (Priority 2):** Triggers if the target is an Actor (`civilian` or `killer`).
3. **Evidence (Priority 3):** Default for static props.

## 2. The Interrogation System
Clicking an NPC pauses their movement and opens the **Interrogation Overlay**.

### Components:
* **The Mugshot:** A 4x scaled render of the actor using their unique `textureKey` and variant index.
* **The Rumor:** Text generated by `getRumorText()`.
* **Witness Memory:** If the NPC was within 250px of a Killer action, they display a "Witness Testimony Recorded" tag.

## 3. Witness Radius (Memory)
The world remembers the Killer's crimes through its inhabitants.
* **Mechanism:** When a Vignette is "Planted," `World.tsx` scans all Civilians within a 250px radius.
* **Storage:** Affected Civilians are updated with a `witnessMemory` object containing a random `visualTrait` from the killer's profile and the `locationName` of the crime.
